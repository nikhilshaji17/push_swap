Node creation:
1. We have to go through the input, and create the nodes for each number
2. Node creation would fail if:
	a. The malloc fails
	b. The number entered crosses INT_MAX
	c. The number entered is lesser than INT_MIN
3. If in case the number does not fail any of these
4. To take the numbers in from the CLI:
	a. Skip all the whitespaces in the beginning
	b. Store the numbers in a long long variable
	c. Check for - and + sign, store the sign in a flag variable
	d. Store all the digits that proceed in a string, and send that string to the atoi function

What if the number is greater than INT_MAX or lesser than INT_MIN?
1. We will check the length of the string that we are sending to the atoi function before sending it.
2. If it is > 10 digits, and it is a positive number, then we can fail it immediately.
3. If it is = 10 digits, and it is a positive number, then we need to check whether it is <= INT_MAX
4. If it is > 10 digits, and it is a negative number, then fail it immediately.
5. If it is = 10 digits, and negative, then check whether it is >= INT_MIN

TO DO:
1. Handle malloc failure for ft_substr
2. Clean up the code for node creation
3. Go through the linked list functions
4. Negative numbers are not being handled appropriately in the node creation process.
5. Focus on the check duplicates function
