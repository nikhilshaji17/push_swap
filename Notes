Node creation:
1. We have to go through the input, and create the nodes for each number
2. Node creation would fail if:
	a. The malloc fails
	b. The number entered crosses INT_MAX
	c. The number entered is lesser than INT_MIN
3. If in case the number does not fail any of these
4. To take the numbers in from the CLI:
	a. Skip all the whitespaces in the beginning
	b. Store the numbers in a long long variable
	c. Check for - and + sign, store the sign in a flag variable
	d. Store all the digits that proceed in a string, and send that string to the atoi function

What if the number is greater than INT_MAX or lesser than INT_MIN?
1. We will check the length of the string that we are sending to the atoi function before sending it.
2. If it is > 10 digits, and it is a positive number, then we can fail it immediately.
3. If it is = 10 digits, and it is a positive number, then we need to check whether it is <= INT_MAX
4. If it is > 10 digits, and it is a negative number, then fail it immediately.
5. If it is = 10 digits, and negative, then check whether it is >= INT_MIN

Duplicate checking:
1. After we create the nodes, the duplicates are checked.
2. If any are found, then the list is cleared in the main function, and I return NULL.

TO DO:
1. Handle malloc failure for ft_substr
2. Clean up the code for node creation
3. Go through the linked list functions - In progress
4. When 3 or more numbers are being entered in between " ", then there is an error in parsing. - Done
